# Problema Algorithm Improvement Report

## Overview
This document explains the improvements and current status of the 'Problema' encryption algorithm, which combines the Enigma algorithm with AES encryption. The Problema algorithm supports both Korean and English, and is designed to process mixed text (cross-language support).
The Problema algorithm has undergone improvements to address initial structural issues, but several problems still remain.
Note that this algorithm was developed as an educational exercise by a student majoring in security and is **not recommended for actual use.**

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Rotor Synchronization Mechanism
- Added functionality to accurately store and restore the initial state of rotors during encryption and decryption
- Improved code to ensure symmetry in rotor rotation patterns
- Implemented precise position calculation logic when applying reverse rotor operations

### 2. Modified Feedback Mechanism

- Added functionality to store and restore initial feedback states
- Separated feedback processing logic according to encryption/decryption modes

### 3. Improved UTF-8 Encoding/Decoding
- Strengthened UTF-8 sequence validation logic
- Enhanced accuracy in processing multi-byte characters (such as Korean)
- Added debug output for easier problem diagnosis
- Reinforced buffer size checks and detailed error messages

### 4. Revised AES Transformations
- Ensured symmetry in SubBytes/InvSubBytes operations
- Improved ShiftRows/InvShiftRows operations
- Enhanced mathematical accuracy of MixColumns/InvMixColumns operations
- Added debug output for each stage to track transformation processes

### 5. Strengthened Debugging Capabilities

- Implemented Unicode character conversion tracking
- Added rotor rotation state monitoring
- Developed block state visualization

## Current Status and Limitations

The Problema algorithm currently has the following limitations:

1. **Incomplete Decryption Accuracy**: While encryption is performed successfully, there are still issues with exactly restoring the original text during decryption. This appears to be due to the following factors:
   - Incomplete symmetry in rotor rotation patterns
   - Irreversibility in the feedback mechanism
   - Subtle inconsistencies between AES transformations and their inverse operations

2. **Performance Optimization Required**: The current implementation focuses on functional verification, necessitating performance optimization.

3. **Memory Management Improvements Needed**: Memory usage optimization is required when processing large volumes of text.

## Future Improvement Plans

1. **Enhancing Decryption Accuracy**:
   - Ensure complete reversibility of the rotor rotation mechanism
   - Redesign feedback state storage and restoration logic
   - Further improve mathematical accuracy of AES transformations

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize core algorithm components
   - Consider implementing parallel processing

3. **Strengthening Security**:
   - Enhance key scheduling algorithm
   - Consider introducing additional encryption layers

4. **Improving Usability**:
   - Develop a more intuitive user interface
   - Support various input and output formats

## Conclusion

The Problema algorithm offers an innovative encryption method that combines the advantages of Enigma and AES while supporting both Korean and English. However, the current version has several limitations, and it is expected that continuous improvements will develop it into a more powerful and reliable encryption solution.
